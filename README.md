# Neural-Network
Simple neural network (using only NumPy) trained to recognize handwritten digits from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Data are too big to store here, so to run code you need to download data first.
This code is really bad, especially the performance is terrible.
I simply wanted to learn how neural nets work under the hood, so I created my own to gain better understanding.
