# Neural-Network
Simple neural network (using only NumPy) trained to recognize handwritten digits from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Data are too big to store here, so to run code you need to download data first.
This code is really bad, especially the performance is terrible.
I simply wanted to learn how neural nets work under the hood, so I created my own to gain better understanding (it helped).

Honestly I am not even sure if training of network works now, and currently I don't have time to look at it and find out and fix it if needed.
But there is small database of networks I created when training it in the past and those networks can be easily loaded and tested.
